Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm Weebox, a Go developer based in France

I discovered programming at 13 yo and was quickly fascinated by it. Since then, I have developed a passion for Golang and have worked hard to improve my skills and become the best possible Go developer.

I look forward to sharing my knowledge and experience with the GitHub developer community and contributing to exciting new projects. If you need a competent and passionate Go developer, do not hesitate to contact me!
